# Learnify — Education Website (HTML + CSS)

This repository contains a small static education website built with plain HTML and CSS. It's a starter template you can customize and deploy with GitHub Pages.

## Files included
- `index.html` — Home page with hero, features, courses preview, and testimonials.
- `courses.html` — List of all courses.
- `course-detail.html` — Single course detail page template.
- `about.html` — About page describing mission and instructors.
- `contact.html` — Contact page with a demo mailto form.
- `styles.css` — Site stylesheet.
- `README.md` — This file.

## How to use
1. Edit HTML files to add your real content and course descriptions.
2. Replace placeholder images with your images (create an `images/` folder and update image `src`).
3. Commit and push to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (branch `main`, folder `/`).
4. Visit `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/` to view your site.
